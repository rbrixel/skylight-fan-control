# skylight-fan-control
Create a skylight-venting with an arduino, a mosfet and old pc fans.

## Hardware used
* Arduino pro mini clone with a ftdi-usb-serial for uploading code
* DHT22 temperature- and humidity-sensor (more headroom than the DTH11); 10k resistor between VCC and DATA
* 3x Push-Buttons with external 10k pull-down-resistors
* 0.96 inch OLED-i2c-Display (128 * 32 px)
* linear-voltage-regulator 7805 with two 100nF and two 100uF capacitors

Feel free to contact me, if you want to support the project :+1:
